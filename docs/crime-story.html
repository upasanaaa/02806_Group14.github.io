    <h1>🔍 Crime in San Francisco: The COVID-19 Lockdown Impact</h1>
    <p class="tagline">A visual data story exploring how pandemic policies changed crime patterns in the city</p>

    <p><strong>Dataset:</strong> This story is based on the official San Francisco Crime dataset (2018–2022), containing timestamps, categories, and districts of reported incidents.</p>

    <p>When San Francisco entered lockdown on <strong>March 17, 2020</strong>, its streets emptied and daily routines paused. But did crime stop too? This story unpacks the shifts in urban crime patterns caused by the pandemic — from the most dangerous hours of the day to which neighborhoods saw the biggest drops (or spikes).</p>

    <h2>🗺️ Which Districts Stayed Unsafe During Lockdown?</h2>
    <p>Even with strict movement restrictions, districts like <strong>Tenderloin</strong> and <strong>Southern</strong> continued reporting high crime. These areas, historically vulnerable due to social factors, didn’t quiet down like others. Meanwhile, residential zones like <strong>Richmond</strong> saw a sharp drop in activity.</p>

    <h2>📍 Before, During, and After Lockdown</h2>
    <p>Compare how crime shifted spatially over time. While lockdowns led to an overall dip, patterns varied district by district.</p>

    <h3>🔹 Before Lockdown</h3>
    <p>Pre-COVID crime was widespread, especially in commercial and nightlife hubs. Mobility meant opportunity for more incidents.</p>

    <h3>🔹 After Lockdown</h3>
    <p>Post-June 2021, crime rose again — not quite returning to pre-pandemic levels, but shifting toward property and vehicle crimes as city activity resumed.</p>

    <h2>🕒 What Time of Day Is Most Dangerous?</h2>
    <p>Even during lockdown, <strong>6–9 PM</strong> remained the riskiest hours. People still ventured out in the evenings — and so did petty crime. Curfews and reduced nightlife lowered late-night incidents, but early evening still posed a threat.</p>

    <h2>📅 Weekday vs Weekend Crime</h2>
    <p>Weekends historically bring higher crime — nightlife, gatherings, and social events increase risk. During lockdown, this trend shrunk, but not evenly. Weekends still saw relatively more incidents in areas like Mission and Tenderloin.</p>

    <h2>🧠 Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tenderloin</strong> remained the most high-crime district across all periods.</li>
      <li>Safe zones included <strong>Park</strong>, <strong>Richmond</strong>, and <strong>Taraval</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Evenings (6–9 PM)</strong> were the most dangerous time of day.</li>
      <li><strong>Weekend crimes</strong> stayed slightly elevated, even in lockdown.</li>
      <li><strong>Crime changed — but it didn’t disappear</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🔚 Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>The pandemic altered how and when crime occurred in San Francisco. While overall incidents fell, the resilience of some patterns highlights deep-rooted social and structural issues. Understanding these shifts can help design smarter urban policies in times of crisis and beyond.</p>
