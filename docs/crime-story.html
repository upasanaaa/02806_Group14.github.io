  <h1>Crime in San Francisco: The COVID-19 Lockdown Impact</h1>

  <p><strong>Dataset:</strong> This story is based on the San Francisco Crime dataset from 2018–2022. It includes timestamps, crime categories, and districts where incidents were reported.</p>

  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic had a massive impact on all aspects of life — including crime. San Francisco, which experienced strict lockdowns from <strong>March 17, 2020</strong> to <strong>June 15, 2021</strong>, showed notable shifts in crime patterns. Below are maps showing crime by district before, during, and after the lockdown period.</p>

  <p>Even during lockdown, districts like <strong>Tenderloin</strong> and <strong>Southern</strong> remained high-crime zones. However, the total number of incidents decreased citywide due to reduced public activity.</p>

  <p>Following the easing of restrictions, crimes started rising again — though in slightly different patterns, possibly due to social and economic changes.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>COVID-19 significantly affected crime levels in San Francisco. While crime didn’t disappear, the shift in patterns is valuable for understanding how policies and crises impact urban safety. District-level analysis helps in identifying long-term trends and areas needing focused interventions.</p>
