  <h1>Crime in San Francisco: The COVID-19 Lockdown Impact</h1>

  <p><strong>Dataset:</strong> This story is based on the San Francisco Crime dataset from 2018–2022. It includes timestamps, crime categories, and districts where incidents were reported.</p>

  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic had a massive impact on all aspects of life — including crime. San Francisco, which experienced strict lockdowns from <strong>March 17, 2020</strong> to <strong>June 15, 2021</strong>, showed notable shifts in crime patterns. Below are maps showing crime by district before, during, and after the lockdown period.</p>
