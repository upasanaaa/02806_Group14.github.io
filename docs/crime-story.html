  <h1>Crime in San Francisco: The COVID-19 Lockdown Impact</h1>

  <p><strong>Dataset:</strong> This story is based on the San Francisco Crime dataset from 2018–2022. It includes timestamps, crime categories, and districts where incidents were reported.</p>

  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic had a massive impact on all aspects of life — including crime. San Francisco, which experienced strict lockdowns from <strong>March 17, 2020</strong> to <strong>June 15, 2021</strong>, showed notable shifts in crime patterns. Below are maps showing crime by district before, during, and after the lockdown period.</p>

  <h2>🗺️ Districts That Stayed Dangerous — Even During Lockdown</h2>

  <p>Even during lockdown, districts like <strong>Tenderloin</strong> and <strong>Southern</strong> remained high-crime zones. However, the total number of incidents decreased citywide due to reduced public activity.</p>

  <h2>🕒 What Time of Day is Most Dangerous?</h2>
  <p>We found that early evening hours (6–9 PM) were the most dangerous overall, even during lockdown. Crimes dropped sharply during curfews and early mornings, but picked back up when people ventured out for essentials or brief outdoor activities.</p>

  <h2>📅 Weekdays vs Weekends: When Do Crimes Spike?</h2>
  <p>Traditionally, weekends see spikes in thefts, assaults, and alcohol-related crimes. During lockdown, weekend crimes dipped but remained slightly higher than weekday levels. Weekday crime patterns flattened, likely due to remote work and business closures.</p>

  <p>Crimes increased again after June 2021. New trends emerged, with car break-ins and burglaries rising as people returned to public life.</p>

  <h2>🔚 Conclusion</h2>
  <p>COVID-19 significantly altered crime levels in San Francisco. While crime didn’t disappear, patterns shifted — revealing how deeply urban safety is tied to social and economic behavior. District-level analysis is key to understanding how cities respond to crisis and recovery.</p>
