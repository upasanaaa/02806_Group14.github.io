  <h1>Crime in San Francisco: The COVID-19 Lockdown Impact</h1>


  <div class="container">
    <h1>SAN FRANCISCO UNDER WATCH</h1>
    <p class="tagline">How Crime Patterns Transformed During the Pandemic Era</p>
    
    
  <p>When San Francisco entered lockdown on March 17, 2020, life in the city changed overnight. Offices closed, streets emptied, and most people stayed home. These changes were expected to affect public safety and crime — but how, and to what extent? This story dives into crime data from 2018 to 2022 to answer that question.</p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <p><strong>About the Data:</strong> This analysis uses the San Francisco Police Department's incident report dataset, containing records of all reported crime incidents in San Francisco. The dataset includes information about crime categories, locations, dates, and times. For this analysis, we compare three distinct periods: before COVID (2018-2019), during lockdown (March 2020 - June 2021), and after restrictions eased (2022-2023).</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Crime Trends During the Pandemic</h2>

  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic created a natural experiment for studying how crime patterns respond to major disruptions in urban life. Our analysis of six key crime categories reveals distinct responses to the lockdown measures.</p>

  <!-- Custom wrapper for crime trend plots -->
  <div class="crime-plot-wrapper">
    <img src="trend.png" ></img>
  </div>
  <p class="caption">Figure 1: Monthly incident counts for overall crime and five specific categories (Vehicle Theft, Vandalism, Burglary, Drug/Narcotic offenses, and Assault) from 2018-2022. Red vertical lines indicate the beginning (March 17, 2020) and end (June 15, 2021) of the lockdown period.</p>

  <p>As shown in Figure 1, overall crime incidents dropped significantly when lockdown began, reflecting the sudden decrease in human activity across the city. However, not all crime categories responded the same way:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Vehicle Theft</strong> increased during lockdown, which could be expected with many cars sitting unused for extended periods, creating opportunities for thieves.</li>
    <li><strong>Burglary</strong> showed an initial spike during early lockdown which at first glance seems suprising as with more people staying inside one could expect that category to occur less frequently, however this is most likely suggesting that burglars targeted closed businesses and empty commercial properties.</li>
    <li><strong>Drug/Narcotic</strong> offenses decreased during lockdown, likely due to the fact that there was much less drug related crimes in public due to most of the people staying at home</li>
    <li><strong>Assault</strong> cases declined as expected with fewer people interacting in public spaces, and the number of incidents was going up gradually and corelated with the loosening of the restrictions.</li>
    <li><strong>Vandalism</strong> saw a moderate decline during early lockdown however the incident number wasn't much different compared to the previous years. After the official lockdown restrictions liftoff the incident number has spiked significantly. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>By the time lockdown restrictions were lifted in June 2021, most crime categories were already trending back toward pre-pandemic levels, though with some notable differences in their recovery patterns. Vehicle theft for example stayed more or less on the same level as druing lockdown and drug related offences were not spiking a lot in number of occurences after the lockdown. Still by looking at the crime trend before, during and after lockdown it's can be said that Covid-19 pandemic has affected the SF criminals as much as any other human in the world.</p>

    
    <h2>Mapping Crime Across Lockdown</h2>
    
    <p>To better understand how the pandemic shaped the distribution of crime across San Francisco, the total number of reported incidents in each police district during three different time periods was mapped. 
      Each map uses color intensity to show the number of incidents per district darker shades indicate more reported crimes. 
      This approach helps highlight that crime is not just a matter of “how much,” but also of “where.”</p>
      <p>To map the number of reported crimes by district, we needed a way to visually represent San Francisco’s police districts on a map. 
        For this we used a separate dataset containing district boundary information.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Before the pandemic</strong><span class="map-caption">(March 17. 2018 - June 15. 2020)</span> This period represents a baseline capturing “normal” crime levels before the pandemic.
         It helps us understand what typical patterns looked like in different districts.</li>
      
      <li><strong>During the COVID-19 lockdown</strong><span class="map-caption">(March 17. 2020 - June 15. 2021)</span>
         arch 17 marked the beginning of strict lockdown and June 15. 2021. was when most restrictions were lifted across California. 
        Analyzing crime during this time reveals how reduced movement and closed businesses impacted the number crime.
      </li>
      
      <li><strong>After most restrictions were lifted</strong><span class="map-caption">(March 17. 2022 - June 15. 2023)</span>
        The final period looks at crime after most of the pandemic restrictions were lifted. 
       This helps us to evaluate whether patterns returned to pre-pandemic norms or whether new pattern, such as remote work or population shifts reshaped where crime occurs in the city.

      </div>
    </div>
    
    <p>During the lockdown period, we can observed a significant drop in crime in traditionally high-traffic districts such as Southern and Central,
       which encompass downtown, the Financial District, and parts of SOMA (South of Market). 
      These are areas that would typically see high number of activity—commuters, tourists, 
      nightlife. With fewer people on the streets, opportunities for certain types of crime likely decreased. These shifts are reflected clearly on the map.
      In contrast, more residential districts such as Ingleside, Bayview, and Taraval maintained or even saw increases in reported incidents. 
      These neighborhoods are characterized by homes, schools, and local businesses—and with more people staying home during the pandemic, 
      the dynamics of everyday life (and crime) shifted away from city centers and into residential areas.

   </p>
   <p>
    After restrictions eased in mid 2021, we see a partial return of incidents to downtown areas, but not fully back to the levels before the pandemic. 
    This may indicate a transformation in urban behavior, such as a rise in remote work, fewer daily commuters, or changes in how and where people report crime.
    These maps shows more than just numbers, they show how crime is linked to the people's life in the city.
     When their life changes for example due to a global pandemic so does the landscape of crime. 
   </p>
   <p>
    A <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/san-francisco-crime-rate-17065509.php" target="_blank"> recent article in the San Francisco Chronicle </a> analyzed police data and came to similar conclusions:
    The reported crime dropped significantly in city-center districts during the pandemic and only partially returned to pre-COVID levels. 
    They noted that some residential districts saw steady or rising incidents, which aligns with the patterns we see in our maps. 
    Researchers also pointed to broader factors like remote work, economic shifts, and underreporting, all of which may have influenced the numbers.

  <h2>WHEN CRIME STRIKES: THE HIDDEN CLOCK OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY</h2>
    <p>The plot below explores an often-overlooked aspect of crime — its timing. While location is commonly mapped, understanding <em>when</em> crime happens reveals deep behavioral patterns. This interactive heatmap allows users to explore hourly trends across top crime categories in San Francisco, filtered by district and pandemic phase.</p>

    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
      <div style="width: 85%; max-width: 1000px;">
        <iframe src="sf_crime_heatmap.html" width="100%" height="680px" style="border: none;"></iframe>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="caption">Figure 3: Interactive heatmap showing when crimes occurred by hour and category. Filters enable exploration by district and COVID-19 period, offering insight into shifting crime rhythms during the pandemic.</p>

    <p>The heatmap displays crime frequency by hour for each major offense type. Each colored block represents the intensity of incidents at a specific time. Darker shades indicate hours with higher reported activity, helping surface patterns that might otherwise remain buried in raw data.</p>

    <p>Even under lockdown conditions, the late afternoon and evening hours consistently remained high-risk across many districts. Some crime types shifted their timing subtly — suggesting that while routines changed, core behavioral rhythms persisted.</p>

    <p><strong>Why does this matter?</strong> Because time is a strategic asset in crime prevention. Understanding <em>when</em> crimes happen allows police departments to adjust patrol schedules, community leaders to target intervention efforts, and city planners to rethink public safety in time as well as space.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, this visualization helps translate numbers into knowledge — giving citizens and decision-makers alike the tools to build smarter, safer, and more responsive urban environments.</p>

    <p>This visualization reveals several critical insights about crime's temporal dimension:</p>
    
    <h3>THE PERSISTENCE OF EVENING HOURS</h3>
    
    <p>Even during lockdown's most restrictive phase, evening hours maintained their status as peak crime periods across most districts. This surprising consistency suggests that certain temporal crime patterns are deeply ingrained, persisting even when routine activities are fundamentally disrupted. For law enforcement, this insight underscores the importance of maintaining evening vigilance even during widespread activity restrictions.</p>
    
    <h3>THE WEEKEND EFFECT</h3>
    
    <p>Despite closed businesses, canceled events, and limited socializing, weekend crime rates remained distinctly higher than weekday levels in many districts. The Mission and Tenderloin exhibited this pattern most prominently, suggesting social behavior patterns that transcend commercial activity. This weekend elevation maintained its rhythm through all pandemic phases, though with reduced magnitude during peak restrictions.</p>
    
    <h2>DISTRICT SPOTLIGHT: WHO SUFFERS MOST?</h2>
    
    <p>San Francisco's crime landscape reveals stark geographic contrasts that persisted and even intensified during the pandemic disruption:</p>
    
    <h3>HIGHEST CRIME DISTRICTS</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tenderloin:</strong> Maintained its position as San Francisco's most crime-challenged district throughout all phases of the pandemic, with consistently elevated rates across most crime categories.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Southern:</strong> Despite significant decreases during peak lockdown, this district covering parts of SoMa quickly returned to elevated crime levels as restrictions eased.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Mission:</strong> Showed distinct weekend spikes throughout all periods, with particular vulnerability to certain property crimes during lockdown.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>LOWEST CRIME DISTRICTS</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Outer Sunset:</strong> Maintained consistently low crime rates across all periods, with only minimal fluctuations during lockdown.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Presidio:</strong> Remained San Francisco's safest district, though interestingly saw small increases in certain property crimes as activity patterns shifted.</li>
      
      <li><strong>West Portal/St. Francis Wood:</strong> These residential enclaves maintained their low-crime status, with only isolated incidents throughout the pandemic period.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">KEY OBSERVATIONS</h3>
      <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        <li>Tenderloin and Southern remained the highest crime zones throughout all pandemic phases.</li>
        <li>Evening hours consistently showed elevated crime rates regardless of mobility restrictions.</li>
        <li>Weekend incidents remained higher than weekday levels even during lockdown's peak.</li>
        <li>Vehicle theft uniquely increased during lockdown, contrary to overall crime trends.</li>
        <li>Geographic crime patterns adapted rapidly to changing urban activity distributions.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>ADAPTIVE CRIME: LESSONS FOR URBAN RESILIENCE</h2>
    
    <p>San Francisco's pandemic crime experience reveals how public safety patterns respond to major urban disruptions in complex, sometimes counterintuitive ways. While overall crime decreased during lockdown, the adaptation was neither uniform nor simple. Certain categories increased, high-risk areas remained vulnerable, and new patterns emerged that challenge conventional understandings of urban crime.</p>
    
    <p>For policymakers and public safety officials, these findings highlight the importance of flexible, data-driven approaches to crime prevention that can adapt to rapidly changing urban conditions. As cities prepare for future disruptions—whether pandemics, climate events, or major policy shifts—understanding these adaptive crime patterns will be essential for creating more resilient and safer urban environments.</p>
    
    <p>Most critically, the persistence of crime in vulnerable neighborhoods throughout the pandemic underscores how certain areas face systemic challenges that transcend temporary disruptions—suggesting the need for sustained, targeted interventions that address underlying social and economic factors driving crime in these communities.</p>
