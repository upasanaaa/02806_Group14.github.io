  <h1>Crime in San Francisco: The COVID-19 Lockdown Impact</h1>


  <div class="container">
    <h1>SAN FRANCISCO UNDER WATCH</h1>
    <p class="tagline">How Crime Patterns Transformed During the Pandemic Era</p>
    
    
  <p>When San Francisco entered lockdown on March 17, 2020, life in the city changed overnight. Offices closed, streets emptied, and most people stayed home. These changes were expected to affect public safety and crime — but how, and to what extent? This story dives into crime data from 2018 to 2022 to answer that question.</p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <p><strong>About the Data:</strong> This analysis uses the San Francisco Police Department's incident report dataset, containing records of all reported crime incidents in San Francisco. The dataset includes information about crime categories, locations, dates, and times. For this analysis, we compare three distinct periods: before COVID (2018-2019), during lockdown (March 2020 - June 2021), and after restrictions eased (2022-2023).</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Crime Trends During the Pandemic</h2>

  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic created a natural experiment for studying how crime patterns respond to major disruptions in urban life. Our analysis of six key crime categories reveals distinct responses to the lockdown measures.</p>

  <!-- Custom wrapper for crime trend plots -->
  <div class="crime-plot-wrapper">
    <img src="trend.png" ></img>
  </div>
  <p class="caption">Figure 1: Monthly incident counts for overall crime and five specific categories (Vehicle Theft, Vandalism, Burglary, Drug/Narcotic offenses, and Assault) from 2018-2022. Red vertical lines indicate the beginning (March 17, 2020) and end (June 15, 2021) of the lockdown period.</p>

  <p>As shown in Figure 1, overall crime incidents dropped significantly when lockdown began, reflecting the sudden decrease in human activity across the city. However, not all crime categories responded the same way:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Vehicle Theft</strong> increased during lockdown, which could be expected with many cars sitting unused for extended periods, creating opportunities for thieves.</li>
    <li><strong>Burglary</strong> showed an initial spike during early lockdown which at first glance seems suprising as with more people staying inside one could expect that category to occur less frequently, however this is most likely suggesting that burglars targeted closed businesses and empty commercial properties.</li>
    <li><strong>Drug/Narcotic</strong> offenses decreased during lockdown, likely due to the fact that there was much less drug related crimes in public due to most of the people staying at home</li>
    <li><strong>Assault</strong> cases declined as expected with fewer people interacting in public spaces, and the number of incidents was going up gradually and corelated with the loosening of the restrictions.</li>
    <li><strong>Vandalism</strong> saw a moderate decline during early lockdown however the incident number wasn't much different compared to the previous years. After the official lockdown restrictions liftoff the incident number has spiked significantly. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>By the time lockdown restrictions were lifted in June 2021, most crime categories were already trending back toward pre-pandemic levels, though with some notable differences in their recovery patterns. Vehicle theft for example stayed more or less on the same level as druing lockdown and drug related offences were not spiking a lot in number of occurences after the lockdown. Still by looking at the crime trend before, during and after lockdown it's can be said that Covid-19 pandemic has affected the SF criminals as much as any other human in the world.</p>

    
    <h2>Mapping Crime Across Lockdown</h2>
    
    <p>To better understand how the pandemic shaped the distribution of crime across San Francisco, the total number of reported incidents in each police district during three different time periods was mapped. 
      Each map uses color intensity to show the number of incidents per district darker shades indicate more reported crimes. 
      This approach helps highlight that crime is not just a matter of "how much," but also of "where."</p>
        <div class="highlight-box">
          <p><strong>About the Data:</strong> To map the number of reported crimes by district, we needed a way to visually represent San Francisco's police districts on a map. 
            For this we used a separate dataset containing district boundary information. (Data Source: <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/san-francisco-crime-rate-17065509.php" target="_blank">Current Police Districts</a>)</p>
        </div>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Before the pandemic</strong><span class="map-caption">(March 17. 2018 - June 15. 2020)</span> This period represents a baseline capturing "normal" crime levels before the pandemic.
         It helps us understand what typical patterns looked like in different districts.</li>
      
      <li><strong>During the COVID-19 lockdown</strong><span class="map-caption">(March 17. 2020 - June 15. 2021)</span>
         arch 17 marked the beginning of strict lockdown and June 15. 2021. was when most restrictions were lifted across California. 
        Analyzing crime during this time reveals how reduced movement and closed businesses impacted the number crime.
      </li>
      
      <li><strong>After most restrictions were lifted</strong><span class="map-caption">(March 17. 2022 - June 15. 2023)</span>
        The final period looks at crime after most of the pandemic restrictions were lifted. 
       This helps us to evaluate whether patterns returned to pre-pandemic norms or whether new pattern, such as remote work or population shifts reshaped where crime occurs in the city.

      </div>
    </div>
    
    <p>During the lockdown period, we can observed a significant drop in crime in traditionally high-traffic districts such as Southern and Central,
       which encompass downtown, the Financial District, and parts of SOMA (South of Market). 
      These are areas that would typically see high number of activity—commuters, tourists, 
      nightlife. With fewer people on the streets, opportunities for certain types of crime likely decreased. These shifts are reflected clearly on the map.
      In contrast, more residential districts such as Ingleside, Bayview, and Taraval maintained or even saw increases in reported incidents. 
      These neighborhoods are characterized by homes, schools, and local businesses—and with more people staying home during the pandemic, 
      the dynamics of everyday life (and crime) shifted away from city centers and into residential areas.

   </p>
   <p>
    After restrictions eased in mid 2021, we see a partial return of incidents to downtown areas, but not fully back to the levels before the pandemic. 
    This may indicate a transformation in urban behavior, such as a rise in remote work, fewer daily commuters, or changes in how and where people report crime.
    These maps shows more than just numbers, they show how crime is linked to the people's life in the city.
     When their life changes for example due to a global pandemic so does the landscape of crime. 
   </p>
   <p>
    A <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/san-francisco-crime-rate-17065509.php" target="_blank"> recent article in the San Francisco Chronicle </a> analyzed police data and came to similar conclusions:
    The reported crime dropped significantly in city-center districts during the pandemic and only partially returned to pre-COVID levels. 
    They noted that some residential districts saw steady or rising incidents, which aligns with the patterns we see in our maps. 
    Researchers also pointed to broader factors like remote work, economic shifts, and underreporting, all of which may have influenced the numbers. 
  </p>

  <h2>WHEN CRIME STRIKES: THE HIDDEN CLOCK OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY</h2>
  
  <p>Beyond mapping where crime happens, there lies another crucial dimension worth exploring: the question of when. As San Francisco's streets emptied and routines changed, did the timing of criminal activity shift as well? This question led to a fascinating exploration of crime's temporal patterns across the city's diverse neighborhoods.</p>

  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
    <div style="width: 85%; max-width: 1000px;">
      <iframe src="sf_crime_heatmap_per.html" width="100%" height="650px" style="border: none;"></iframe>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p class="caption">Figure 3: Interactive heatmap showing crime occurrence by hour and category. Users can filter by district and pandemic period to explore patterns.</p>

  <p>This heatmap functions much like the pulse of San Francisco throughout the day. Each row represents a crime category, while columns track the 24-hour cycle. The color intensity tells the story: darker cells reveal higher incident counts at that hour. Residents can select their own district and preferred time period, uncovering patterns unique to their neighborhood during different pandemic phases.</p>

  <p>The heatmap clearly shows that most crimes in San Francisco happened during the evening, especially between 6 PM and 11 PM. This pattern stayed the same across all pandemic periods, such as before, during, and after lockdowns. Even though daily life changed drastically during COVID-19 with people working from home, nightlife shutting down, and streets nearly empty, the times when crimes occurred remained surprisingly consistent. Crimes like assault and robbery were common in the late evening.</p>

  <p>This finding is important because it shows that crime has a regular daily pattern that doesn't easily change, even during major disruptions like a global pandemic. The heatmap helps visualize these patterns clearly by showing how different types of crime vary by hour and by district. For public safety planners, police departments, and local authorities, this kind of insight is valuable. It helps them understand not just where and how much crime is happening but also when to expect it, allowing them to plan resources, patrols, and prevention strategies more effectively.</p>


  <h2>DISTRICT SPOTLIGHT</h2>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">KEY OBSERVATIONS</h3>
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      <li>Tenderloin and Southern remained the highest crime zones throughout all pandemic phases.</li>
      <li>Evening hours consistently showed elevated crime rates regardless of mobility restrictions.</li>
      <li>Vehicle theft uniquely increased during lockdown, contrary to overall crime trends.</li>
      <li>Geographic crime patterns adapted rapidly to changing urban activity distributions.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>ADAPTIVE CRIME: LESSONS FOR URBAN RESILIENCE</h2>

  <p>San Francisco's pandemic crime experience reveals how public safety patterns respond to major urban disruptions in complex ways. While overall crime decreased during lockdown, certain categories increased, high-risk areas remained vulnerable, and new patterns emerged that challenge conventional understandings of urban crime.</p>

  <p>For policymakers and public safety officials, these findings highlight the importance of flexible, data-driven approaches that can adapt to rapidly changing urban conditions. Most critically, the persistence of crime in vulnerable neighborhoods throughout the pandemic underscores how certain areas face systemic challenges that transcend temporary disruptions—suggesting the need for sustained interventions that address underlying social and economic factors driving crime in these communities.</p>
