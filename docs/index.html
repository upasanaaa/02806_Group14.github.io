    <h1>SAN FRANCISCO UNDER WATCH</h1>
    <p class="tagline">How Crime Patterns Transformed During the Pandemic Era</p>
    
    <p class="intro">When San Francisco entered lockdown on March 17, 2020, the city's rhythm changed overnight. Streets emptied, businesses closed, and residents retreated indoors. This unprecedented shift in urban activity created a natural experiment—revealing surprising adaptations in criminal behavior and challenging long-held assumptions about urban safety.</p>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p><strong>ABOUT THE DATA:</strong> This analysis draws from the San Francisco Police Department's comprehensive incident report dataset, documenting all reported crimes from 2018 to 2023. We examine patterns across three distinct periods: pre-pandemic (2018-2019), lockdown (March 2020-June 2021), and recovery (2021-2023). The dataset provides rich detail on crime categories, locations, timestamps, and incident characteristics.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>THE PANDEMIC EFFECT: CRIME'S SEISMIC SHIFT</h2>
    
    <p>The COVID-19 lockdown fundamentally disrupted San Francisco's crime landscape. As human activity retreated from public spaces, overall crime volumes dropped sharply—but this surface-level decline masked complex adaptations occurring beneath. Our analysis reveals how different crime categories responded to this unprecedented urban disruption.</p>
    
    <div class="crime-plot-wrapper">
      <iframe src="crime_trend_plot.html" scrolling="no"></iframe>
    </div>
    <p class="caption">Figure 1: Monthly crime incidents across key categories from 2018-2022. The red vertical lines mark the beginning (March 17, 2020) and end (June 15, 2021) of San Francisco's COVID-19 lockdown period, revealing distinct adaptation patterns for different crime types.</p>
    
    <p>While overall incidents dropped when lockdown began, the response varied dramatically by crime category—revealing how criminal activity adapts to changing opportunity structures:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Vehicle Theft</strong> <span class="key-stat">increased significantly</span> during lockdown. With cars sitting unused for extended periods and reduced street activity, thieves found new opportunities in the changed urban landscape.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Burglary</strong> showed an initial <span class="key-stat">sharp spike</span> at lockdown's onset before gradually declining. This pattern suggests criminals quickly targeted vulnerable empty businesses and commercial properties before adapting to increased home occupancy.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Drug/Narcotic</strong> offenses <span class="key-stat">plummeted dramatically</span>, reflecting both reduced public activity and a significant shift in law enforcement priorities during the pandemic.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Assault</strong> cases initially declined but remained more stable than property crimes, suggesting that interpersonal violence has different drivers than opportunity-based property crime.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Vandalism</strong> dipped initially but <span class="key-stat">surged upward</span> in mid-2021 as the city began reopening, potentially reflecting renewed social tensions as urban activity resumed.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="pull-quote">
      "Crime didn't simply disappear during lockdown—it transformed, adapting rapidly to new patterns of urban life and revealing the complex relationship between urban activity and criminal opportunity."
    </div>
    
    <p>By the time restrictions lifted in June 2021, most crime categories were already trending back toward pre-pandemic levels, though with distinct recovery trajectories that reveal lasting impacts of the disruption.</p>
    
    <h2>SHIFTING GEOGRAPHIES: WHERE CRIME MOVED</h2>
    
    <p>Perhaps most striking was how the pandemic reshaped crime's geographic footprint across San Francisco. As downtown emptied and residential occupancy increased, criminal activity redistributed itself in ways that challenge conventional understanding of urban crime patterns.</p>
    
    <div class="map-container">
      <div class="map-box">
        <div class="map-title">Before Lockdown (2018-2020)</div>
        <iframe src="map_prelockdown.html"></iframe>
        <p class="map-caption">Crime concentrated in the downtown corridor, Financial District, and tourist zones prior to lockdown.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="map-box">
        <div class="map-title">During Lockdown (2020-2021)</div>
        <iframe src="map_lockdown.html"></iframe>
        <p class="map-caption">The pandemic dramatically altered crime distribution, with previously busy areas seeing significant drops while vulnerable neighborhoods remained problematic.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="map-box">
        <div class="map-title">After Lockdown (2021-2023)</div>
        <iframe src="map_postlockdown.html"></iframe>
        <p class="map-caption">As restrictions eased, crime began returning to pre-pandemic patterns but with notable new hotspots emerging in previously moderate-risk areas.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <p>These maps reveal three distinct geographic narratives across time periods:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pre-Lockdown (2018-2020):</strong> Crime was highly concentrated in San Francisco's commercial heart—the downtown corridor, Financial District, and SoMa—with pronounced hotspots in tourist-heavy areas like Union Square and Fisherman's Wharf. The Mission District showed elevated weekend activity, reflecting its nightlife prominence.</li>
      
      <li><strong>During Lockdown (2020-2021):</strong> As downtown emptied, crime distribution fundamentally shifted. The Central District saw crime drop by nearly <span class="key-stat">45%</span>, while persistent hotspots remained in vulnerable areas like the Tenderloin. Certain residential corridors saw modest increases as crime adapted to new opportunity structures.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Post-Lockdown (2021-2023):</strong> The recovery period revealed an uneven return to pre-pandemic patterns. While traditional hotspots began reactivating, new concentrations emerged in areas that previously had moderate crime levels, suggesting lasting changes in the city's crime geography.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Most revealing is how high-vulnerability neighborhoods like the Tenderloin maintained elevated crime levels throughout all periods—suggesting that certain areas face persistent challenges regardless of broader urban conditions.</p>
    
    <h2>TEMPORAL RHYTHMS: WHEN CRIME HAPPENS</h2>
    
    <p>Beyond where crime occurred, the pandemic fundamentally altered when it happened. As daily routines dissolved, traditional crime cycles transformed, revealing deeper patterns in criminal behavior. The interactive visualization below allows exploration of these temporal shifts across neighborhoods, crime types, and time periods.</p>
    
    <iframe src="bokeh_plot.html" height="500px" width="100%"></iframe>
    <p class="caption">Figure 3: Interactive exploration of crime's temporal patterns. Filter by district, crime category, time period, and day type to uncover how the pandemic reshaped when crimes occurred across different neighborhoods.</p>
    
    <p>This visualization reveals several critical insights about crime's temporal dimension:</p>
    
    <h3>THE PERSISTENCE OF EVENING HOURS</h3>
    
    <p>Even during lockdown's most restrictive phase, evening hours maintained their status as peak crime periods across most districts. This surprising consistency suggests that certain temporal crime patterns are deeply ingrained, persisting even when routine activities are fundamentally disrupted. For law enforcement, this insight underscores the importance of maintaining evening vigilance even during widespread activity restrictions.</p>
    
    <h3>THE WEEKEND EFFECT</h3>
    
    <p>Despite closed businesses, canceled events, and limited socializing, weekend crime rates remained distinctly higher than weekday levels in many districts. The Mission and Tenderloin exhibited this pattern most prominently, suggesting social behavior patterns that transcend commercial activity. This weekend elevation maintained its rhythm through all pandemic phases, though with reduced magnitude during peak restrictions.</p>
    
    <h2>DISTRICT SPOTLIGHT: WHO SUFFERS MOST?</h2>
    
    <p>San Francisco's crime landscape reveals stark geographic contrasts that persisted and even intensified during the pandemic disruption:</p>
    
    <h3>HIGHEST CRIME DISTRICTS</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tenderloin:</strong> Maintained its position as San Francisco's most crime-challenged district throughout all phases of the pandemic, with consistently elevated rates across most crime categories.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Southern:</strong> Despite significant decreases during peak lockdown, this district covering parts of SoMa quickly returned to elevated crime levels as restrictions eased.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Mission:</strong> Showed distinct weekend spikes throughout all periods, with particular vulnerability to certain property crimes during lockdown.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>LOWEST CRIME DISTRICTS</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Outer Sunset:</strong> Maintained consistently low crime rates across all periods, with only minimal fluctuations during lockdown.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Presidio:</strong> Remained San Francisco's safest district, though interestingly saw small increases in certain property crimes as activity patterns shifted.</li>
      
      <li><strong>West Portal/St. Francis Wood:</strong> These residential enclaves maintained their low-crime status, with only isolated incidents throughout the pandemic period.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">KEY OBSERVATIONS</h3>
      <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        <li>Tenderloin and Southern remained the highest crime zones throughout all pandemic phases.</li>
        <li>Evening hours consistently showed elevated crime rates regardless of mobility restrictions.</li>
        <li>Weekend incidents remained higher than weekday levels even during lockdown's peak.</li>
        <li>Vehicle theft uniquely increased during lockdown, contrary to overall crime trends.</li>
        <li>Geographic crime patterns adapted rapidly to changing urban activity distributions.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>ADAPTIVE CRIME: LESSONS FOR URBAN RESILIENCE</h2>
    
    <p>San Francisco's pandemic crime experience reveals how public safety patterns respond to major urban disruptions in complex, sometimes counterintuitive ways. While overall crime decreased during lockdown, the adaptation was neither uniform nor simple. Certain categories increased, high-risk areas remained vulnerable, and new patterns emerged that challenge conventional understandings of urban crime.</p>
    
    <p>For policymakers and public safety officials, these findings highlight the importance of flexible, data-driven approaches to crime prevention that can adapt to rapidly changing urban conditions. As cities prepare for future disruptions—whether pandemics, climate events, or major policy shifts—understanding these adaptive crime patterns will be essential for creating more resilient and safer urban environments.</p>
    
    <p>Most critically, the persistence of crime in vulnerable neighborhoods throughout the pandemic underscores how certain areas face systemic challenges that transcend temporary disruptions—suggesting the need for sustained, targeted interventions that address underlying social and economic factors driving crime in these communities.</p>
