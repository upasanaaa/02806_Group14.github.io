  <h1>Crime in San Francisco: The COVID-19 Lockdown Impact</h1>

  <p>When San Francisco entered lockdown on March 17, 2020, life in the city changed overnight. Offices closed, streets emptied, and most people stayed home. These changes were expected to affect public safety and crime — but how, and to what extent? This story dives into crime data from 2018 to 2022 to answer that question.</p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <p><strong>About the Data:</strong> This analysis uses the San Francisco Police Department's incident report dataset, containing records of all reported crime incidents in San Francisco. The dataset includes information about crime categories, locations, dates, and times. For this analysis, we compare three distinct periods: before COVID (2018-2019), during lockdown (March 2020 - June 2021), and after restrictions eased (2022-2023).</p>
  </div>

  <p>By analyzing trends before, during, and after the lockdown period (March 2020 – June 2021), we uncover critical insights: crime did not disappear, but it transformed. For public agencies and city planners, understanding these changes is key to building more resilient and safer urban environments in both crisis and recovery.</p>

  <h2>Crime Volume Over Time: The Pandemic Effect</h2>

  <div class="figure">

    <p class="caption">Figure 1: Monthly crime incidents by category in San Francisco (2018-2023). Note the significant drop across most categories during the initial lockdown period, followed by varying recovery patterns.</p>
  </div>

  <p>During the strict lockdown phase, overall crime volume fell across the city — a natural outcome of reduced human mobility. The time series reveals that total reported incidents dropped by approximately 30% in April 2020 compared to April 2019. However, this reduction wasn't evenly distributed across crime categories.</p>
  
  <p>While theft-related crimes saw the most dramatic decreases (down nearly 50% at the peak of lockdown), violent crimes showed more resilience, declining by only 15-20%. As restrictions eased in 2021 and 2022, different crime categories recovered at varying rates, with property crimes rebounding more quickly than others.</p>

  <h2>A Geographic Shift: Crime During Lockdown</h2>

  <p>The pandemic didn't just change how much crime occurred — it changed where it happened. High-crime districts like <strong>Tenderloin</strong> and <strong>Southern</strong> remained consistently dangerous, while residential neighborhoods such as <strong>Richmond</strong>, <strong>Park</strong>, and <strong>Taraval</strong> became even safer.</p>

  <p class="caption">Figure 2: Crime distribution across San Francisco districts during COVID-19 lockdown (March 2020 - June 2021). Darker areas indicate higher crime concentration.</p>

  <h3>Before Lockdown</h3>
  <p>Prior to the pandemic, crime was widespread, especially in commercial and transit zones. Activity was driven by movement — thefts near offices, pickpocketing downtown, and nightlife-related offenses.</p>

  <p class="caption">Figure 3: Crime distribution before lockdown (March 2018 - March 2020). Note the concentration in downtown, SoMa, and entertainment districts.</p>

  <h3>After Lockdown</h3>
  <p>Following the reopening of the city in mid-2021, crime levels began to rise again, but with notable differences from pre-pandemic patterns. Property crimes such as car break-ins became more prominent, and new hotspots began to emerge in areas that previously saw lower crime rates.</p>

  <h2>Exploring Temporal Patterns Interactively</h2>

  <p>Beyond geography, the pandemic disrupted when crimes occurred. The interactive visualization below lets you explore monthly crime trends filtered by district, category, year, and day type, revealing how neighborhoods responded differently across time.</p>

  <h2>Key Insights from the Data</h2>
  
  <h3>Evening Hours: A Persistent Danger</h3>
  <p>The early evening hours (6–9 PM) remained the most dangerous time throughout all phases. Even during strict lockdown, incidents peaked during these hours, suggesting that certain crime patterns persist regardless of mobility restrictions. This insight points to the need for targeted crime prevention efforts even when broader mobility is reduced.</p>

  <h3>Weekday vs. Weekend</h3>
  <p>Despite closures of entertainment venues and nightlife, weekends still saw 25-30% more incidents than weekdays in many districts. The Mission and Tenderloin in particular exhibited this trend — pointing to social behavior patterns that extend beyond open businesses or events.</p>

  <h2>Key Observations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tenderloin and Southern remained the highest crime zones before, during, and after lockdown, maintaining approximately 30% higher incident rates than other districts.</li>
    <li>6–9 PM consistently posed the greatest safety risks, accounting for about 25% of daily incidents across all time periods.</li>
    <li>Weekend incidents remained higher than weekday levels, even during lockdown, though the gap narrowed from a pre-pandemic difference of 40% to approximately 25% during lockdown.</li>
    <li>Crime dipped during lockdown but surged again with a change in type and location, with property crimes showing the fastest recovery as the city reopened.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion: Implications for Urban Planning and Public Safety</h2>
  <p>This analysis shows how citywide policies shape public safety — but not always equally. By exploring how crime patterns shifted during the pandemic, we learn that structural vulnerabilities persist even under emergency conditions. High-risk areas remained dangerous, and temporal patterns proved surprisingly resilient.</p>
  
  <p>For urban planners and public safety officials, these findings suggest the need for targeted approaches that account for both geographic and temporal crime patterns. Rather than uniform city-wide measures, effective crime prevention may require neighborhood-specific strategies that address the unique vulnerabilities and patterns of each area.</p>
  
  <p>Moving forward, data-informed decision-making will be key to more equitable safety planning in San Francisco and beyond, especially as cities continue to adapt to hybrid work models and changing urban usage patterns in the post-pandemic era.</p>
