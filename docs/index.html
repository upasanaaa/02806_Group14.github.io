  <h1>Crime in San Francisco: The COVID-19 Lockdown Impact</h1>


  <div class="container">
    <h1>SAN FRANCISCO UNDER WATCH</h1>
    <p class="tagline">How Crime Patterns Transformed During the Pandemic Era</p>
    
    
  <p>When San Francisco entered lockdown on March 17, 2020, life in the city changed overnight. Offices closed, streets emptied, and most people stayed home. These changes were expected to affect public safety and crime — but how, and to what extent? This story dives into crime data from 2018 to 2022 to answer that question.</p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <p><strong>About the Data:</strong> This analysis uses the San Francisco Police Department's incident report dataset, containing records of all reported crime incidents in San Francisco. The dataset includes information about crime categories, locations, dates, and times. For this analysis, we compare three distinct periods: before COVID (2018-2019), during lockdown (March 2020 - June 2021), and after restrictions eased (2022-2023).</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Crime Trends During the Pandemic</h2>

  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic created a natural experiment for studying how crime patterns respond to major disruptions in urban life. Our analysis of six key crime categories reveals distinct responses to the lockdown measures.</p>

  <!-- Custom wrapper for crime trend plots -->
  <div class="crime-plot-wrapper">
    <img src="trend.png" ></img>
  </div>
  <p class="caption">Figure 1: Monthly incident counts for overall crime and five specific categories (Vehicle Theft, Vandalism, Burglary, Drug/Narcotic offenses, and Assault) from 2018-2022. Red vertical lines indicate the beginning (March 17, 2020) and end (June 15, 2021) of the lockdown period.</p>

  <p>As shown in Figure 1, overall crime incidents dropped significantly when lockdown began, reflecting the sudden decrease in human activity across the city. However, not all crime categories responded the same way:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Vehicle Theft</strong> increased during lockdown, which could be expected with many cars sitting unused for extended periods, creating opportunities for thieves.</li>
    <li><strong>Burglary</strong> showed an initial spike during early lockdown which at first glance seems suprising as with more people staying inside one could expect that category to occur less frequently, however this is most likely suggesting that burglars targeted closed businesses and empty commercial properties.</li>
    <li><strong>Drug/Narcotic</strong> offenses decreased during lockdown, likely due to the fact that there was much less drug related crimes in public due to most of the people staying at home</li>
    <li><strong>Assault</strong> cases declined as expected with fewer people interacting in public spaces, and the number of incidents was going up gradually and corelated with the loosening of the restrictions.</li>
    <li><strong>Vandalism</strong> saw a moderate decline during early lockdown however the incident number wasn't much different compared to the previous years. After the official lockdown restrictions liftoff the incident number has spiked significantly. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>By the time lockdown restrictions were lifted in June 2021, most crime categories were already trending back toward pre-pandemic levels, though with some notable differences in their recovery patterns. Vehicle theft for example stayed more or less on the same level as druing lockdown and drug related offences were not spiking a lot in number of occurences after the lockdown. Still by looking at the crime trend before, during and after lockdown it's can be said that Covid-19 pandemic has affected the SF criminals as much as any other human in the world.</p>

    
    <h2>Mapping Crime Across Lockdown</h2>
    
    <p>To better understand how the pandemic shaped the distribution of crime across San Francisco, the total number of reported incidents in each police district during three different time periods was mapped. 
      Each map uses color intensity to show the number of incidents per district darker shades indicate more reported crimes. 
      This approach helps highlight that crime is not just a matter of “how much,” but also of “where.”</p>

    <h2>TEMPORAL RHYTHMS: WHEN CRIME HAPPENS</h2>
    
    <p>Beyond where crime occurred, the pandemic fundamentally altered when it happened. As daily routines dissolved, traditional crime cycles transformed, revealing deeper patterns in criminal behavior. The interactive visualization below allows exploration of these temporal shifts across neighborhoods, crime types, and time periods.</p>
    
    <iframe src="bokeh_plot.html" height="500px" width="100%"></iframe>
    <p class="caption">Figure 3: Interactive exploration of crime's temporal patterns. Filter by district, crime category, time period, and day type to uncover how the pandemic reshaped when crimes occurred across different neighborhoods.</p>
    
    <p>This visualization reveals several critical insights about crime's temporal dimension:</p>
    
    <h3>THE PERSISTENCE OF EVENING HOURS</h3>
    
    <p>Even during lockdown's most restrictive phase, evening hours maintained their status as peak crime periods across most districts. This surprising consistency suggests that certain temporal crime patterns are deeply ingrained, persisting even when routine activities are fundamentally disrupted. For law enforcement, this insight underscores the importance of maintaining evening vigilance even during widespread activity restrictions.</p>
    
    <h3>THE WEEKEND EFFECT</h3>
    
    <p>Despite closed businesses, canceled events, and limited socializing, weekend crime rates remained distinctly higher than weekday levels in many districts. The Mission and Tenderloin exhibited this pattern most prominently, suggesting social behavior patterns that transcend commercial activity. This weekend elevation maintained its rhythm through all pandemic phases, though with reduced magnitude during peak restrictions.</p>
    
    <h2>DISTRICT SPOTLIGHT: WHO SUFFERS MOST?</h2>
    
    <p>San Francisco's crime landscape reveals stark geographic contrasts that persisted and even intensified during the pandemic disruption:</p>
    
    <h3>HIGHEST CRIME DISTRICTS</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tenderloin:</strong> Maintained its position as San Francisco's most crime-challenged district throughout all phases of the pandemic, with consistently elevated rates across most crime categories.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Southern:</strong> Despite significant decreases during peak lockdown, this district covering parts of SoMa quickly returned to elevated crime levels as restrictions eased.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Mission:</strong> Showed distinct weekend spikes throughout all periods, with particular vulnerability to certain property crimes during lockdown.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>LOWEST CRIME DISTRICTS</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Outer Sunset:</strong> Maintained consistently low crime rates across all periods, with only minimal fluctuations during lockdown.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Presidio:</strong> Remained San Francisco's safest district, though interestingly saw small increases in certain property crimes as activity patterns shifted.</li>
      
      <li><strong>West Portal/St. Francis Wood:</strong> These residential enclaves maintained their low-crime status, with only isolated incidents throughout the pandemic period.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">KEY OBSERVATIONS</h3>
      <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        <li>Tenderloin and Southern remained the highest crime zones throughout all pandemic phases.</li>
        <li>Evening hours consistently showed elevated crime rates regardless of mobility restrictions.</li>
        <li>Weekend incidents remained higher than weekday levels even during lockdown's peak.</li>
        <li>Vehicle theft uniquely increased during lockdown, contrary to overall crime trends.</li>
        <li>Geographic crime patterns adapted rapidly to changing urban activity distributions.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>ADAPTIVE CRIME: LESSONS FOR URBAN RESILIENCE</h2>
    
    <p>San Francisco's pandemic crime experience reveals how public safety patterns respond to major urban disruptions in complex, sometimes counterintuitive ways. While overall crime decreased during lockdown, the adaptation was neither uniform nor simple. Certain categories increased, high-risk areas remained vulnerable, and new patterns emerged that challenge conventional understandings of urban crime.</p>
    
    <p>For policymakers and public safety officials, these findings highlight the importance of flexible, data-driven approaches to crime prevention that can adapt to rapidly changing urban conditions. As cities prepare for future disruptions—whether pandemics, climate events, or major policy shifts—understanding these adaptive crime patterns will be essential for creating more resilient and safer urban environments.</p>
    
    <p>Most critically, the persistence of crime in vulnerable neighborhoods throughout the pandemic underscores how certain areas face systemic challenges that transcend temporary disruptions—suggesting the need for sustained, targeted interventions that address underlying social and economic factors driving crime in these communities.</p>
