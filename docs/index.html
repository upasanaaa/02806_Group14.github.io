  <h1>Crime in San Francisco: The COVID-19 Lockdown Impact</h1>

  <p>When San Francisco entered lockdown on March 17, 2020, life in the city changed overnight. Offices closed, streets emptied, and most people stayed home. These changes were expected to affect public safety and crime — but how, and to what extent? This story dives into crime data from 2018 to 2022 to answer that question.</p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <p><strong>About the Data:</strong> This analysis uses the San Francisco Police Department's incident report dataset, containing records of all reported crime incidents in San Francisco. The dataset includes information about crime categories, locations, dates, and times. For this analysis, we compare three distinct periods: before COVID (2018-2019), during lockdown (March 2020 - June 2021), and after restrictions eased (2022-2023).</p>
  </div>

  <p>By analyzing trends before, during, and after the lockdown period (March 2020 – June 2021), we uncover critical insights: crime did not disappear, but it transformed. For public agencies and city planners, understanding these changes is key to building more resilient and safer urban environments in both crisis and recovery.</p>

  <h2>Crime Trends During the Pandemic</h2>

  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic created a natural experiment for studying how crime patterns respond to major disruptions in urban life. Our analysis of five key crime categories reveals distinct responses to the lockdown measures.</p>

  <div class="crime-plot-wrapper">
    <iframe class="crime-plot" src="crime_trend_plot.html" scrolling="no"></iframe>
  </div>
  <p class="caption">Figure 1: Monthly incident counts for overall crime and five major categories (Vehicle Theft, Vandalism, Burglary, Drug/Narcotic offenses, and Assault) from 2018-2022. Red vertical lines indicate the beginning (March 17, 2020) and end (June 15, 2021) of the lockdown period, while the purple line shows the first confirmed COVID-19 case in San Francisco (January 20, 2020).</p>

  <p>As shown in Figure 1, overall crime incidents dropped significantly when lockdown began, reflecting the sudden decrease in human activity across the city. However, not all crime categories responded the same way:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Vehicle Theft</strong> surprisingly increased during lockdown, with many cars sitting unused for extended periods, creating opportunities for thieves.</li>
    <li><strong>Burglary</strong> showed an initial spike during early lockdown before decreasing, suggesting criminals initially targeted closed businesses and empty commercial properties.</li>
    <li><strong>Drug/Narcotic</strong> offenses decreased dramatically during lockdown, likely due to reduced law enforcement focus on these crimes and fewer people in public spaces.</li>
    <li><strong>Assault</strong> cases declined initially but remained more stable than property crimes throughout the pandemic.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>By the time lockdown restrictions were lifted in June 2021, most crime categories were already trending back toward pre-pandemic levels, though with some notable differences in their recovery patterns.</p>

  <h2>A Decline in Volume — But Not in Risk</h2>

  <p>During the strict lockdown phase, overall crime volume fell across the city — a natural outcome of reduced human mobility. But this reduction wasn't evenly distributed. High-crime districts like <strong>Tenderloin</strong> and <strong>Southern</strong> remained consistently dangerous.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, residential neighborhoods such as <strong>Richmond</strong>, <strong>Park</strong>, and <strong>Taraval</strong> became even safer. Their lower population density, limited nightlife, and stronger community presence may have contributed to the drop.</p>

  <p class="caption">Figure 2: Crime distribution across San Francisco districts during COVID-19 lockdown (March 2020 - June 2021). Darker areas indicate higher crime concentration.</p>

  <h3>Before Lockdown</h3>
  <p>Crime was widespread, especially in commercial and transit zones. Activity was driven by movement — thefts near offices, pickpocketing downtown, and nightlife-related offenses.</p>
  
  <iframe src="map_prelockdown.html"></iframe>
  <p class="caption">Figure 3: Crime distribution before lockdown (March 2018 - March 2020). Note the concentration in downtown, SoMa, and entertainment districts.</p>

  <h3>After Lockdown</h3>
  <p>Following the reopening of the city in mid-2021, crime levels began to rise again. Property crimes such as car break-ins became more prominent, and new hotspots began to emerge.</p>

  <p class="caption">Figure 4: Crime distribution after lockdown restrictions eased (June 2021 - June 2023). Observe the emergence of new hotspots and the gradual return to pre-pandemic patterns.</p>

  <h2>Exploring Temporal Patterns Interactively</h2>

  <p>Beyond geography, the pandemic fundamentally transformed <em>when</em> crimes occurred across San Francisco. As daily routines were disrupted, traditional crime cycles shifted in unexpected ways. The visualization below invites you to explore these temporal transformations yourself.</p>
  
  <p>This interactive tool reveals crime's hidden rhythms—how patterns of activity fluctuated throughout the year, differed between weekdays and weekends, and varied across neighborhoods during this unprecedented period. By filtering the data through multiple dimensions, you can uncover insights that static visualizations might miss.</p>
  
  <p>For instance, try comparing the Northern district's weekend patterns before and during lockdown, or observe how the Mission's crime profile changed when restrictions lifted. Each combination tells a unique story about how specific communities experienced the pandemic's impact on public safety.</p>

  <h2>Key Insights from the Data</h2>
  
  <h3>Temporal Patterns</h3>
  <p>Even during lockdown, certain times of day consistently showed higher crime rates. Evening hours remained particularly problematic across most districts, suggesting that some temporal crime patterns persist regardless of mobility restrictions. This insight points to the need for targeted crime prevention efforts even when broader mobility is reduced.</p>

  <h3>Weekday vs. Weekend</h3>
  <p>Despite closures, weekends still saw more incidents than weekdays in many districts. The Mission and Tenderloin in particular exhibited this trend — pointing to social behavior patterns that extend beyond open businesses or events.</p>

  <h2>Key Observations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tenderloin and Southern remained the highest crime zones before, during, and after lockdown.</li>
    <li>Certain times of day consistently showed higher crime rates throughout all phases.</li>
    <li>Weekend incidents remained higher than weekday levels, even during lockdown.</li>
    <li>Vehicle theft was uniquely positioned as a crime category that increased during lockdown, contrary to overall trends.</li>
    <li>Crime dipped during lockdown but surged again with a change in type and location.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>This study of San Francisco crime during COVID-19 reveals how citywide disruptions affect public safety in complex ways. While overall crime decreased during lockdown, certain categories (notably vehicle theft) increased, and high-risk areas remained dangerous. This suggests that crime patterns adapt quickly to changing circumstances, with criminals finding new opportunities even during major societal disruptions.</p>
  
  <p>For policymakers and public safety officials, these findings highlight the importance of flexible, data-driven approaches to crime prevention that can adapt to rapidly changing urban conditions. As San Francisco and other cities prepare for future disruptions—whether pandemics, natural disasters, or major policy shifts—understanding these adaptive crime patterns will be essential for creating more resilient and safer urban environments.</p>
