  <h1>Crime in San Francisco: The COVID-19 Lockdown Impact</h1>

  <p>When San Francisco entered lockdown on March 17, 2020, life in the city changed overnight. Offices closed, streets emptied, and most people stayed home. These changes were expected to affect public safety and crime — but how, and to what extent? This story dives into crime data from 2018 to 2022 to answer that question.</p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <p><strong>About the Data:</strong> This analysis uses the San Francisco Police Department's incident report dataset, containing records of all reported crime incidents in San Francisco. The dataset includes information about crime categories, locations, dates, and times. For this analysis, we compare three distinct periods: before COVID (2018-2019), during lockdown (March 2020 - June 2021), and after restrictions eased (2022-2023).</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Crime Trends During the Pandemic</h2>

  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic created a natural experiment for studying how crime patterns respond to major disruptions in urban life. Our analysis of six key crime categories reveals distinct responses to the lockdown measures.</p>

  <!-- Custom wrapper for crime trend plots -->
  <div class="crime-plot-wrapper">
    <iframe src="crime_trend_plot.html" scrolling="no"></iframe>
  </div>
  <p class="caption">Figure 1: Monthly incident counts for overall crime and five specific categories (Vehicle Theft, Vandalism, Burglary, Drug/Narcotic offenses, and Assault) from 2018-2022. Red vertical lines indicate the beginning (March 17, 2020) and end (June 15, 2021) of the lockdown period.</p>

  <p>As shown in Figure 1, overall crime incidents dropped significantly when lockdown began, reflecting the sudden decrease in human activity across the city. However, not all crime categories responded the same way:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Vehicle Theft</strong> surprisingly increased during lockdown, with many cars sitting unused for extended periods, creating opportunities for thieves.</li>
    <li><strong>Burglary</strong> showed an initial spike during early lockdown before decreasing, suggesting criminals initially targeted closed businesses and empty commercial properties.</li>
    <li><strong>Drug/Narcotic</strong> offenses decreased dramatically during lockdown, likely due to reduced law enforcement focus on these crimes and fewer people in public spaces.</li>
    <li><strong>Assault</strong> cases declined initially but remained more stable than property crimes throughout the pandemic.</li>
    <li><strong>Vandalism</strong> saw a moderate decline during early lockdown but increased significantly in mid-2021 as the city began reopening.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>By the time lockdown restrictions were lifted in June 2021, most crime categories were already trending back toward pre-pandemic levels, though with some notable differences in their recovery patterns.</p>

  <h2>Geographic Crime Patterns Across Time Periods</h2>

  <p>The pandemic didn't just change how much crime occurred — it changed where it happened. The maps below show how the geographic distribution of crime shifted dramatically as the city's activity patterns transformed.</p>

  <!-- Three maps displayed side by side -->
  <div class="map-container">
    <div class="map-box">
      <div class="map-title">Before Lockdown (2018-2020)</div>
      <iframe src="map_prelockdown.html"></iframe>
      <p class="map-caption">Crime was concentrated in downtown, SoMa, and entertainment districts before the pandemic.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="map-box">
      <div class="map-title">During Lockdown (2020-2021)</div>
      <iframe src="map_lockdown.html"></iframe>
      <p class="map-caption">During lockdown, crime decreased overall but high-risk areas like Tenderloin remained dangerous.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="map-box">
      <div class="map-title">After Lockdown (2021-2023)</div>
      <iframe src="map_postlockdown.html"></iframe>
      <p class="map-caption">As restrictions eased, new hotspots emerged and crime gradually returned to pre-pandemic patterns.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pre-Lockdown (2018-2020):</strong> Crime was highly concentrated in the downtown corridor, Financial District, and SoMa area, with significant hotspots in tourist destinations like Union Square and Fisherman's Wharf. The Mission District also showed elevated crime levels, particularly on weekends.</li>
    
    <li><strong>During Lockdown (2020-2021):</strong> Overall crime volume decreased, but the geographic distribution changed dramatically. Downtown areas saw the most significant drops (approximately 45% in the Central District), while the Tenderloin, parts of SoMa, and certain residential corridors maintained relatively higher crime rates.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Post-Lockdown (2021-2023):</strong> Crime began returning to pre-pandemic patterns but with notable differences. New hotspots emerged in areas that previously had moderate crime levels, and the recovery was uneven across neighborhoods, with some areas seeing faster returns to pre-pandemic crime levels than others.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These geographic shifts highlight how crime patterns adapt to changing urban conditions. While high-vulnerability areas like Tenderloin remained problematic throughout all periods, other neighborhoods experienced significant fluctuations based on changing activity patterns and opportunity structures.</p>

  <h2>Exploring Temporal Patterns Interactively</h2>

  <p>Beyond geography, the pandemic fundamentally transformed <em>when</em> crimes occurred across San Francisco. As daily routines were disrupted, traditional crime cycles shifted in unexpected ways. The visualization below invites you to explore these temporal transformations yourself.</p>
  
  <p>This interactive tool reveals crime's hidden rhythms—how patterns of activity fluctuated throughout the year, differed between weekdays and weekends, and varied across neighborhoods during this unprecedented period. By filtering the data through multiple dimensions, you can uncover insights that static visualizations might miss.</p>
  
  <p>For instance, try comparing the Northern district's weekend patterns before and during lockdown, or observe how the Mission's crime profile changed when restrictions lifted. Each combination tells a unique story about how specific communities experienced the pandemic's impact on public safety.</p>

  <h2>Key Insights from the Data</h2>
  
  <h3>Temporal Patterns</h3>
  <p>Even during lockdown, certain times of day consistently showed higher crime rates. Evening hours remained particularly problematic across most districts, suggesting that some temporal crime patterns persist regardless of mobility restrictions. This insight points to the need for targeted crime prevention efforts even when broader mobility is reduced.</p>

  <h3>Weekday vs. Weekend</h3>
  <p>Despite closures, weekends still saw more incidents than weekdays in many districts. The Mission and Tenderloin in particular exhibited this trend — pointing to social behavior patterns that extend beyond open businesses or events.</p>

  <h2>Key Observations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tenderloin and Southern remained the highest crime zones before, during, and after lockdown.</li>
    <li>Certain times of day consistently showed higher crime rates throughout all phases.</li>
    <li>Weekend incidents remained higher than weekday levels, even during lockdown.</li>
    <li>Vehicle theft was uniquely positioned as a crime category that increased during lockdown, contrary to overall trends.</li>
    <li>Crime dipped during lockdown but surged again with a change in type and location.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>This study of San Francisco crime during COVID-19 reveals how citywide disruptions affect public safety in complex ways. While overall crime decreased during lockdown, certain categories (notably vehicle theft) increased, and high-risk areas remained dangerous. This suggests that crime patterns adapt quickly to changing circumstances, with criminals finding new opportunities even during major societal disruptions.</p>
  
  <p>For policymakers and public safety officials, these findings highlight the importance of flexible, data-driven approaches to crime prevention that can adapt to rapidly changing urban conditions. As San Francisco and other cities prepare for future disruptions—whether pandemics, natural disasters, or major policy shifts—understanding these adaptive crime patterns will be essential for creating more resilient and safer urban environments.</p>
